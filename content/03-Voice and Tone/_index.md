# Voice and Tone

One way we write empowering content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to Crunchy.

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.

## Voice

At Crunchy, we’ve walked in our customers' shoes, and we know PostgreSQL and its related technologies can be a minefield of confusing terminology. That’s why we speak like the experienced and compassionate business partner we wish we’d had way back when.

We treat every user seriously. We want to educate people without patronizing or confusing them.

Whether people know what they need from us or don’t know the first thing about Postgres, every word we say informs and encourages. We impart our expertise with clarity and empathy.

All of this means that when we write content:

1. **We are plainspoken.** We value clarity above all. Because businesses come to Crunchy to get to work, we avoid distractions like fluffy metaphors and cheap plays to emotion.

2. **We are genuine.** We relate to customers’ challenges and passions and speak to them in a familiar, warm, and accessible way.

3. **We are translators.** Only experts can make what’s difficult look easy, and it’s our job to demystify database and open-source speak and actually educate.

## Tone

When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. <!--Are they confused and seeking our help on Twitter? --> Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.

It's alright to be funny when it’s appropriate and when it comes naturally to you. But don’t go out of your way to make a joke—forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.

## Style tips

Here are a few key elements of writing Crunchy’s voice. For more, see the [Grammar and mechanics section](./04-grammar-and-mechanics.md).
