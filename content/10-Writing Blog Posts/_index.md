## Guidelines

When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Be casual, but smart
This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

### Get to the point
Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads. Our users are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Link it up
Feel free to link away from Crunchy pages if it helps you explain something.

### Use tags and keywords
In Hubspot, add keywords that apply to your article. Look through existing posts for common tags. If you’re not sure if a word should be a tag, it probably shouldn’t.

### Use pictures
Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you’re explaining how to use a GUI tool, screenshots can help illustrate your point. Make sure to use alt text.
